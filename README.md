This project was inspired by Codenjoy (<a href="http://codenjoy.com/portal/">http://codenjoy.com/portal/</a>). Thanks to Alexander Baglay aka apofig who create it and organize cool contest.

You need to write script that control board.

The first game is Tetris. The next will be 2048, I think.

For the Tetris script can move falling figure left and right. Very easy!
